# APPS 20: Options for Data in the Cloud

## Session Abstract

Abstract: Tailwind Traders is a large retail corporation, with a dangerous single point of failure: sales, fulfillment, monitoring, and telemetry data is centralized across its online and brick and mortar outlets. Weâ€™ll review structured databases, unstructured data,  real-time data, file storage considerations, and share tips on balancing performance, cost, and operational impacts.

In this session, youâ€™ll learn how Tailwind Traders created a flexible data strategy using multiple Azure services, such as AzureSQL, CosmosDB, the CosmosDB Mongo API, and more â€“ and how to overcome common challenges and find the right storage option.
