# APPS10: Options for Building and Running Your App in the Cloud  

## Session Abstract

Weâ€™ll show you how Tailwind Traders avoided a single point of failure, using cloud services to deploy their company website to multiple regions. Weâ€™ll cover all the options they considered, explain how and why they made their decisions, then dive into the components of their implementation.  

In this session, youâ€™ll see how they used Microsoft technologies like VS Code, Azure Portal, and Azure CLI to build a secure application that runs and scales on Linux and Windows VMs and Azure Web Apps, with a companion phone App.  

The session [Ignite Learning Paths - APPS10](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths/tree/master/apps/apps10).

## Deployment / Preparation

The following steps are necessary to prepare for APPS10 demos.

### Required Software

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
1. Install the [Remote extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) for VSCOde. 
1. You will need [SSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) installed. 
    * If you need a set of keys, open a terminal and execute the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` remember where you put the information (usually C:\Users\<USERNAME>/.ssh/ ) and your passphrase (aka password). 

### Suggested setup to present

> You should have a few things open a ready:

- PowerPoint
- Browser Tab: Portal Azure Dashboard/ home
- Browser Tab: Tailwind traders website (from PaaS solution)
- Browser Tab: Scale sets Resource Group
- Browser Tab: PaaS Resource Group
- Browser Tab: Key Vault
- Visual Studio Code, with the Azure CLI to create a scale set
    ```
    az vmss create \
        -g $RGName \
        -n myScaleSet \
        --image "/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/myGalleryRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/images/myImageDefinition/versions/1.0.0" \
        --admin-username azureuser \
        --generate-ssh-keys
   ```
- ZoomIt (or another application that zoom your screen) should be running, there is tiny stuff to show.


## Demos

> What's Here? Pre-delivery preparation, stage ready videos, required files (such as JSON templates), and walk-through videos

Detailed explanations of each demonstration associated with this presentation can be found in this section. There are 3 "live from stage" technical demonstrations that utilize a number of tools both in and out of Azure. [You can get a high level overview of the tools and how we will be using them here](demos/demo-instructions.md).
