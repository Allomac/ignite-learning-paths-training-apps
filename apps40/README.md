# APPS40: Consolidating Infrastructure with Azure Kubernetes Service
 
# Modernizing Your Application with Containers


## Session Abstract
Kubernetes is the open source container orchestration system that supercharges applications with scaling and reliability and unlocks advanced features, like A/B testing, Blue/Green deployments, canary builds, and dead-simple rollbacks.

In this session, youâ€™ll see how Tailwind Traders took a containerized application and deployed it to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Youâ€™ll walk away with a deep understanding of major Kubernetes concepts and how to put it all to use with industry standard tooling.
